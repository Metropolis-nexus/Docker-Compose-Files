# Miniflux Docker Compose

## Setup

Edit the environment variables in .env to set your credentials.

## Custom Styling

Apply `style.css` in the `Custom CSS` section in settings. This theme is from [reeseovine/miniflux-midnight](https://github.com/reeseovine/miniflux-midnight), I just removed the google remote google CSS lines as they are not necessary and cause issues with CSP. There is no license file in the repository reeseovine's repository, but upstream has licensed it under MIT.
